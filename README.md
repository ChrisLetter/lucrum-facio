## About the project

 Crypto portfolio tracker, that allows users to add their crypto and the farms/staking providers where they deposited the funds, with the corresponding APY. The app will help them to keep track of where they allocated the funds and to see the total APY averaged across all the farms.
 For the moment it supports only single asset pools.
### Built with:

Next.js, React, Redux, Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo Client, PostgreSQL, Prisma, JWT, CoinGecko API
